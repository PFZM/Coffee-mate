## Project Title:

Coffe Morning App

## Project description:

The Coffee Morning App is designed for the user view during their morning coffee for their daily dose of internet goodness.

It will ask the user for the following information and preferences:

Location => for weather display
Zodiac sign => to determine their starsign a daily horoscope reading
Favorite music genre => to display the song of the day
Activity type preference => to have a relevant type of activity suggested

All the above items will be displayed in an interactive way. The app will also display the following random item:

- Insult of the day
